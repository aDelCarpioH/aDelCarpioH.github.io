            <H2>LEARNING PYTHON - OCR MANAGER</H2>
            
            <p>
                The project's goal is to learn python basics. Defining the next problem, the needs to difitalize a purchase ticket and manage that information.
                I used an OCR library to recognize the image text and be able to save the information.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started developing a function to recognize the image text folowing the indications from this web page https://nanonets.com/blog/ocr-with-tesseract/.
                Throughout the development of this application I was researching about the different Python's characteristics as progrmamming language, as the variables definition, loops, functions, clases, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                About the next steps developing the project, I decide using MVC architecture, because as a web developer I'm more familiar with this architecture, so I use the MVC folder structure, one for the models, one for the views and anothe for the controllers.
                Also repository pattern and bussiness layers pattern was used. The bussiness layer owns the OCR funtionality that aloows us the text recognition from the purchase tickets.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project show me how friendly is Python, realizing that with a few lines of code you can get a functional application method. Also with the library ussage it was friendly, 
                using pip I didn't have any problem installing them, I commet this, because in the begining this project should have been done in C# using Net Core, but I had a lot of problems 
                installing the differents libraries and it never worked and I gave up. 

                The most complex methond in the application was the OCR method, that took at least 20 minutes, while revieweing the documentation.

                This project was useful to practice the diferent programming patterns and realize their benefits.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just to sumarize, learning Python is a good decision if you want enter in the application developing world, also you will realize it is a strong 
                tool to allow you solve different kind of problems.
            </p>
